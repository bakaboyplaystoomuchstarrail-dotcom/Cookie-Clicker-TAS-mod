# Cookie-Clicker-Optimizer
My goal is simple. To destroy cookie clicker by finding the definitive fastest way to 100% the game. I've decided to tackle this process in steps. I figured that the first thing we should focus on is the fundamental game loop of cookie clicker, that being the actual generation of cookies. This will act as a framework to show us the fastest paths to be able to afford certain purchases and reach certain achievement milestones and ascension requirements. Programming the code necessary to achieve the non baking related achievements shouldn't be too difficult since that isn't where the complexity of the game lies, it's in the interconnectedness between the features and this issue is resolved by us establishing a good foundation. 



This program was created with the help of the ADE Warp, an artificial itelligence assitant.
